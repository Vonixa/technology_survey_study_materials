# The Undefined Goal
There are no formal standards for software engineering. There is no licensing board.

# Duck Typing
Some programming languages allow data to be unclassified (i.e. "It's just stuff!").
To determine what data are in these cases, one can't just ask a single overall question
(e.g. "Is this a table?")
but instead asks a series of simpler questions and classifies data if all the answers
conform with the classification
(e.g. "Does it have four legs?", "Is it inert?", and "Does it have a flat surface?").
