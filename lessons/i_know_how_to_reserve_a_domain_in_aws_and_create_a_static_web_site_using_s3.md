## What Is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is the concept of using (renting) publicly-available
computer services instead of purchasing, hosting, and maintaining
the necessary hardware and software one would normally need to host
web applications (and other software technology) by oneself.

### What Are the Advantages of Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing companies (like Amazon) make A Lot of money off of providing
this service. Intuition would suggest that it's better for a typical company
to just purchase and maintain its own computer hardware and software with
the added benefit of having full ownership over everything.

But typical companies actually want to use cloud computing for reasons including
the following -
  - Companies want to focus on what they're good at ('core competencies')
    and not be distracted by things they aren't necessarily proficient at.
    A bread company probably doesn't immediately know or care about Unix
    system administration; learning about Unix system administration would
    be a terrible distraction. It's better (and likely cheaper) to hire
    the experts than do it on one's own.
  - Cloud computing allows companies to instantaneously change the technologies
    and quantity of those technologies ('scale'). For accounting reasons,
    companies Hate acquiring fixed assets (like a computer) which are outside
    of the core business and which only depreciate (become less valuable)
    with time. Based on experience, it can even take several weeks for
    a company to get a new computer server following corporate procurement
    policies.

#### If Companies Like Cloud Computing, Why Do They Still Develop Their Own Software?

Companies don't always develop their own software and instead frequently pay
another company ('outsource') to develop and maintain the software instead.

But companies still frequently develop software on their own because
the software is either too close to the core function of the business
or a key representation of the brand of the business (like its web site).
In these cases, ownership and responsiveness to change are important.

## What Is AWS?
AWS stands for Amazon Web Services and it's Amazon's cloud computing platform.
As of late 2019, AWS is the most popular cloud computing platform
and produces the majority of profits for Amazon.

## Important Disclaimer - Using AWS Costs Money
In most cases, using AWS costs money although with vigilance total costs
to host a small web site should cost under $10 per month (in 2019).

Be careful when using AWS and stick to a budget.
