## The Importance of Communication

Beyond very small software projects and those just involving one person,
software projects tend to involve many people, some of which don't
necessarily have a technical background - especially business people
and project managers (those who track who is working on what
and whether to overall project is on schedule).

Software projects tend to be expensive and often involve
many people often on different teams (even different continents).
It's vitally important that they all are in generally agreements
about the goals and deliverables of the project ('on the same page').

### It's Quite Important to Agree on What Should Be Done

With regards to a larger ('corporate' or 'enterprise') software
project, `What should be done?` is answered people from the business
domain (with roles like product owner, portfolio manager,
and business analyst) of the organization who are responsible
for business goals and budget allocations. They answer this question
by issuing and maintaining a `requirements document`.

#### Newer and More Agile Forms of Communication

Publishing and maintaining a lengthy document that everyone references
may seem ideal, but in some circumstances it can be bureaucratic
(requiring lots of approvals) and not even up-to-date. Organizations
have increasingly adopted alternative forms documenting requirements.
One example is having a 'story' (a few paragraphs of requirements)
for each requirement and then using this collection of stories
as the set of requirements for a project. (If a requirements document
is analogous to an oil-based painting, stories are more like a collage.)

Company-internal projects are better candidates for the story approach
because the company is only accountable to itself (it knows what it's
getting and can easily adjust what it defines as success).

Inter-company projects (like a government defence contract) with legal
constraints and clear payment goals are much more likely to use
and maintain a formal requirements document.

### It's Quite Important to Specify the Details

It's up to the technical domain (with roles like architect and
technical lead) answer `How will it be done?` with a `technical
specification`. That document can specify what hardware will support
the application, how events will be logged, and what software packages
will be used.

Again, while intuition might suggest that such a document is ideal,
for internal projects the source code itself is often the
specification on its own.

### It's Quite Important to Make Corrections Earlier Than Later

It's far easier to make a change while the project is being
first devised than after its implementation is complete. For instance,
deciding to change the color of a button on a web page can happen
instantaneously before the web page is developed but can take hours
or more after the web page is developed (work then could include
changing the code, preparing the application for deployment,
then verifying that the change was made).

## Wireframes

Wireframes are simplistic pictures of how the web page should look.
Even for a small software project with just one developer, using
wireframes can be a lot of fun and help conceptualize what's important
and what's missing in the overall features of a web application.

Wireframes can be used in both requirements and specification documents.

### draw.io

`draw.io` is a free online diagramming application. There are other
such applications (including very good commercial ones). `draw.io`
also supports (includes) components for designing wireframes.

#### Using draw.io

1) Go to https://www.draw.io/
2) Click 'Device' (to load and save drawings to the local computer)
3) Click 'Create New Diagram'
4) Select 'Blank Diagram' then click 'Create'
5) Scroll down the left pane and click 'More Shapes...'
6) Uncheck everything except the following, then click 'Apply'
  - General
  - Basic
  - Arrows
  - Android
  - Mockups
7) Review the icons under the different sections in the left pane
  - Under the 'Mockup Containers' section, there is a 'Browser Window'
  icon that can act as the base of a desktop-based wireframe
  - Under the 'Android' section, there is a 'Phone' icon that can act
  as the base of a mobile-based wireframe
  - The 'Mockup Forms' section contains HTML form elements
  - The 'Mockup Graphics' section contains a 'Map' icon
  - The 'Mockup Text' section contains 'Link' and 'Text Box' icons

## Pictures

Web developers usually don't create graphics. Graphic designers
create them instead and then the web developers use them.
