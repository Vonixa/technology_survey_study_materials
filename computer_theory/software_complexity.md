why are developers keep using more complex tools?
the most smart and determined ones set the standard
and are good at finding shortcomings with existing tools,
even if they are easy to use

complexity grows with lines of code

simple things are predictable and (much) easier to maintain

software development has grown more powerful
but also much more complicated over the last few decades
- security, testing, build processes, accessibility, internationalization, code reviews, project planning, fault tolerance

software project budgets are quite large (often even
in the tens of millions of dollars), but businesses are willing
to pay that money to comprehensively cover all aspects of the 
software delivery process, improve the customer's experience,
and enhance brand
