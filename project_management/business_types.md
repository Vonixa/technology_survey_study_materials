Corp-To-Corp ('C2C')
- Many contracting firms won't accept a C2C arrangement
- study the contract
- frequent considerations - onboarding costs (like background check)
payment cycle, types of insurance

contracting doesn't have to put up as much with the corporate soap opera

fundamentally, what's more important than any of this is whether
there is a market for your skills

importance of long tenures (it's good to have a respectable billable
rate for a longer assignment than have a somewhat higher rate
for a shorter assignment)

it's easiest to look for a job when you have one

lengthy resumes can actually be bad

recruiters generally like listing skills
elite companies generally like shorter resumes
to be honest, employers may look at years of experience
but are most often interested in your last assignment

importance of networking, even for engineers
if you did a good job on an assignment and you are likeable, you
will frequently be called back

unemployment is the most costly

middle-age lifestyles are expensive with children,
especially if only one adult in the household is working

retirement accounts and other savings vehicles are definitely
recommended, but often take vital cash out of the household budget

employers want an engaging and fun personality,
but definitely expect you to get your work done
and don't want to put up with your ego

information assymetries in corporations

salary curves, no matter how exceptional the performance, one's
salary and promotion potential are limited by years of experience
in larger companies

doing a specific job well doesn't necessarily match the ideal
candidate for a more senior job

budgets are frequently destiny in a large corporation

corporations are risk adverse (can become recalcitrant)
- note how leading tech corporations have changed over the decades

why the boss isn't your friend (and corporate HR especially isn't)

tolerating uncomfortable situations, learn to stick things out until
it's the right time to leave
