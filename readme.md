# Welcome to My Technology Survey Study Materials

## For now, just worry about this section

  - [Syllabus](syllabus.md)
  - [Software Installation](setup_instructions/software_installations.md)

## Goal
The goal of these study materials is to provide a survey of technology.

### Who Can Benefit
These study materials can probably help the following.

Those just wondering 'how it all works' with regards to web technologies.
Those considering a career as an application developer.
Some job openings give an edge to those with some app development understanding, this might help.
Those looking to create a web application soon and want some direction.

## Where to Start
Pick a section that interests you from the Table of Contents below that's marked `Easy`.

## How to Read These Study Materials
These study materials are written in `markdown` format. A great way to review
them is to install the `Markdown Reader` extension into Chrome and view them in Chrome
which can be done by just entering the file location of this file into the
Chrome browser's address bar (e.g. like '/Users/yourusername/Desktop/technology_survey_study_materials/readme.md'
on Mac).

Before doing that, first make sure that it can view local system files by clicking the `M` icon in the top-right,
selecting `Manage Extentions`, then enabling the `Allow access to file URLs` option. Then reload this page.

### A Great Way to Start a Project
Because tech projects have so much up-front overhead, it's easy to get overly involved in the initial setup
which can discourage you and lead to (endless?) procrastination.

A possible way to counteract that is to first dream about what the project should be and document it
in a `readme` file like this in `markdown` format. Next, define key web services between client and server
in a `swagger` document. After that, start development.

You don't get what you deserve in life, you get what you negotiate
Plans are useless, planning is everything
Adulthood is a bunch of people fighting over money
All over the world, people universally like having their status raised
Mature means able to withstand shock and no longer growing, be the first not the second
Sex selection is different than natural selection
Between the ages of 22 and 42, you have about 1.5 points to allocate between career, experiences, and family (max of 1 point in each of these three areas)
Much of life is a numbers game (importance of networking)
If following a prudent approach, most retirement savings occurs before age 40

how to tell if someone is interested in getting married
happiness curve throughout life
principal-agent problem (why college professors don't teach this material)
Sell agreeability (understand power dynamics of situation)
People hate their competition
People generally want to be heard, not spoken to
Neighborhood matters (someone's family background, salary for a career, an actual house)
Talk to other people, get their perspectives
Ask your peers what they are doing
Career goals most negatively associated with making money - I want to help others, I want to know the truth
Loss of control is a key source of unhappiness
No entangling alliances
Maybe of most successful peers started out in engineering but didn't remain there
Be mindful of health, even at a young age, understand what an obese BMI is, understand the different types of dietary fiber
Don't be resentful of the success of others and gloat when they have a setback
Be skeptical (but not completely so) of someone's advice from an advantaged situation
Young start in a position of weakness, rules of society have already been written by others
Don't get arrested or have a criminal record
Doors of life start closing as you progress into adulthood (reference Weatherman clip)
This is all going to change
If it were a dinner, you expect adulthood to be 1000 calories when it'll actually 700. Pop culture tells you that it will be 1500 while religion tells you that it will be 400.
Pray to God but row to shore
People generally say what they sell and usually don't advocate something that's against their interests
"You can't expect someone to understand something if he or her salary depends on not understanding it"
Pick a winner, work, live below your means, invest well, marry well, don't have children
Importance of tolerating job situations and family circumstances (endurance)
Don't gloat in the setbacks of others or feel negatively about their successes
Show - the other f word
Don't underestimate yourself - others want/desire what you have to offer
You can help those in need and shouldn't always expect the best out of others, but watch out for loafers too

'According to Gallup, Americans report that their ideal number of children per family is 2.6, a number which has remained unchanged since the late 1970s.'
Robert Shiller advice - 'keep living like a student'
Ask your parents - 'is your job a grind?'
If you help someone who is uninterested, expect them not to appreciate your sacrifice as much as you do
