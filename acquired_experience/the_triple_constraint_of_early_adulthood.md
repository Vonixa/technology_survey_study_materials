This isn't a sensitive topic, but it's my opinion.
Please review with your parents.

## What Is This?

I, Gary, am currently 44 years old (in 2019). In studying my own life
and the lives of my peers, I've noticed a present-but-not-that-strong
trade-off between three domains - experiences, finances, and family -
in the first twenty years after college (roughly from ages 22 to 42).
For the typical person, it seems like many critical decisions that define
one's overall life are made during this period.

  - What made life interesting?
  - How much did I save for retirement?
  - What line of work did I pursue?
  - What kind of marriage and parenthood situation did I end up with?
  - Where did I live?

In project management, the trade-off in product development is between
time, cost, and features. Likewise, I think, there is some trade-off
in early adulthood (20 years following college) between experiences,
finances, and family. All three of these domains are worthy pursuits
but advancing in one domain at times can mean de-prioritizing the other two.

## Your Budget
(Very) roughly speaking, you have about 150 total percentage points
to allocate between these three areas with no area receiving more
than 100 percent.

Obviously, this can vary greatly between persons and circumstances.
For instance, Bill Gates got immensely rich by founding Microsoft
near where he grew up and got heavily involved in philanthropic work
so he probably has allocated at or near 100 percent in each area.

You can change your allocation over time.

## Experiences
  - Do I like my job?
  - Do I travel a lot and take frequent vacations?
  - Am I studying an interesting topic in school?
  - Can I easily move?
  - Do I have interesting hobbies?
  - Is my budget for enjoyable things like eating out and clothing ample?
  - Do I have an extensive social life?
  - Do I like my residence?
  - To what extent will I be involved in religious or ideological causes?

## Finances
  - Am I saving for retirement?
  - Is my job or line-of-work stable?
  - Am I out of debt or paying it off?
  - Do I have an extensive professional network?

## Family
  - Can I readily visit family members and easily attend family functions?
  - Am I raising children?
  - For newborn children, am I able to take leave from work if I choose?
  
## The Lesson
These are the the years of your life in which you have the most
flexibility, capabilities, and energy - and you do not get them back!
Figure out what's important to you and periodically reevaluate.

Good generals can be decisive in winning a war, but a good quartermaster
can be critical too. Understand the trade-offs of your life decisions
and avoid unhappy and avoidable situations that waste time.

### Things to Avoid
  - Unemployment
    - During my twenties and early thirties, I had a tendency
    to job hop and be unemployed for at least a few months in between.
    Likewise, I tried to start a business with no clearly-defined means
    of earning money (duh). In retrospect, I should have been much
    more stingy about entering into periods of unemployment, had longer
    tenures at jobs, and been wary to start a business unless
    I really was confident that people would pay me for a product
    or service.
  - Living away from family in a city you don't like
    - I stayed in Silicon Valley after the Dot-Com bubble burst
    (around 2002) hoping that things would return to the glory days.
    They never did and I was frequently (though not always) unhappy
    to be living out there.
  - Staying in a romantic relationship that isn't going anywhere
    - This isn't my area of expertise and requires careful judgement!
    I didn't do this but in retrospect it might have helped to have
    gotten married sooner. (Caution - People who get married after
    their early twenties have lower divorce rates.) On this topic,
    I have heard of cases where people want to get married but are in
    relationships where there partner strings them along ('time thief')
    and then decides to end things.
  - Staying in school for no good reason and acquiring a lot of debt
    - I didn't do this and it might have helped to get a master's degree,
    but I know of people who spent unhappy years on academic tracks
    (even accumulating debt) when they could have been in the workforce.
    Likewise, I know people who have gotten professional degrees who
    have done far better than me professionally. Before getting more
    education, evaluate its overall return (especially financial return)
    especially in the context of the schools reputation. Degree programs
    with fixed (time and credit) completion standards (like a masters
    or a professional degree) are probably preferable to open-ended
    programs (like a doctoral degree).
